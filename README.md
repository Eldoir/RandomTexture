# RandomTexture

Use this if you want to randomize the texture of any object in your project.

## Getting Started

For a quick import into an existing project, just get the UnityPackage.

The DemoProject folder is an empty project with only the plugin imported and some examples! :)

## Prerequisites

There are absolutely no prerequisites to this plugin.

Everything comes into a few files (and most of them are used for demo).
