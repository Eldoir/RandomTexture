# RandomTexture

Use this if you want to randomize the texture of any object in your project.

## Getting Started

For a quick import into an existing project, just get the UnityPackage.

If you want first to test this Plugin in a new empty project, that's what the DemoProject is! :)

### Prerequisites

There are absolutely no prerequisites to this plugin.

Everything comes into a few files (and most of them are used for demo).
